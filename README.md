# DataStructures-Algorithms
Data Structure and basic algorithm implementations in Python

This repository aims at understanding certain data structures and algorithms by implementing them from scratch as a project in PyCharm. Each class and function have a set of basic tests written o verify the correctness of the implementations.

## Data Structures
Data Structures implemented so far:
* Arrays
* Singly Linked Lists
* Doubly Linked Lists
* Queue
* Stack
* Deque
* Find Union
* Heap
* 

## Algorithms:
Algorithms that are related to a certain DS are implemented inside the DS module. Most of the algorithm implementations are done in LeetCode and are not copied here. This folder may be deleted in the future.
